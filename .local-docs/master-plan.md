3. **No Financial Safety Net** - Can't rely on family credit or extensive support
4. **Complex Financial System** - New to US banking, credit, taxes
5. **Reckless Spending** - Easy to overspend on convenience (UberEats, etc.)
6. **Lack of Financial Education** - No guidance on US personal finance

### **Current Solutions Gap:**
- Existing apps (Mint, YNAB) are too generic
- No focus on student-specific challenges
