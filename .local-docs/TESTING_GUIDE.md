### **Step 2: Complete Onboarding Flow**
1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000/onboarding
2. **Complete 3-Step Setup**:
   - **Step 1**: Choose budget (e.g., $1200 Comfortable, USD, Yes to meal plan)

#### **💰 SafeToSpendCard:**

### **Step 4: Test Non-Onboarded User Experience**
1. **Go to debug page**: http://localhost:3000/debug
2. **Click**: "Clear All Data"
3. **Go to dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## 🎓 **EXPECTED PERSONALIZATION EXAMPLES**

### **Sample User: Sarah (Comfortable Budget)**
- **Setup**: $1200/month, USD, meal plan, rent $600, meal plan $200
- **Welcome**: "Your $1200 budget with meal plan gives you $385 for fun stuff! 🎓"
- **Daily Safe**: "$12 per day this month"
- **Insights**: "🍕 Your $200 meal plan is saving you money on food!", "✨ Your balanced budget gives you comfort and flexibility!"

### **Sample User: Alex (Tight Budget)**
- **Setup**: $800/month, USD, no meal plan, rent $500, utilities $50
- **Welcome**: "You've got $250 available from your $800 monthly budget! 🚀"
- **Daily Safe**: "$8 per day this month"
- **Insights**: "💪 Managing on a tight budget? You're building great financial habits!"

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL TESTING**

### **localStorage Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
localStorage.getItem('financialCopilot_onboardingComplete') // "true"
localStorage.getItem('financialCopilot_userData') // JSON object
```

### **Expected Data Flow:**
1. **Onboarding** saves data → localStorage
2. **Dashboard** loads data → onboardingService
3. **SafeToSpendCard** receives personalizedData prop
4. **Calculations** use real budget instead of API data

### **Fallback Behavior:**
- [ ] If onboarding incomplete → show backend data
- [ ] If backend fails but onboarding exists → show personalized data
- [ ] If both fail → show loading/error states
